I've decided to make my resume in HTML/CSS, and I'm hosting it on GitHub
because GitHub is great.  You can find the resume in the following places:

* [Web Version](http://sjelin.github.io/resume)
* [PDF Version](http://sjelin.github.io/resume/Martin%20Samuel%20Jelin%27s%20Resume.pdf) (use this version for printing)

#### License

I'm using MIT license.  Not sure why you'd ever want to fork this but if you
want to I'd be honored :D
